# Zomato-Excel-Data-Analysis


## Introduction :

This project is all about worldwide Zomato Market and its services availability among different countries. Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in more than 1,000 Indian cities and towns, as of 2022â€“23. Zomato rivals Swiggy in food delivery and hyperlocal space. In this Excel Project, I have used excel features to create this interactive dashboard. In this I have shown the connection of Zomato from the whole world and its overall ratings from the whole 15 countries. I have also described the number of restaurants in the countries, types of services available like has online delivery or not, will deliver it now or not and has table booking or not. Through these data I have made a beautiful interactive dashboards that consist of two pages. First one is for Cities wise distribution under Country category and the second one was about the top 3 cities, cuisines, restaurants and localities.

## Conclusion :

This Project is helpful in analysizing the sales market of Zomato. From this Project I would like to conclude that as Zomato is an Indian Company thats why is market is broader in India than in other countries as it is linked with only 15 countries and out of that 15 countries, It has greatly expanded its routes in India therefore all the top items from different categories are from India only. In India it has main markets in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. Currently the services of Zomato is also limited which creates a breaker in its expansion. If the company will focus upon their advance services then they may be able to expand their branch and market worldwide. The main motive of this project is to gain knowledge about Zomato Company and its worldwide connections and to learn new features of excel.
